Part 2 – NoSQL Product Catalog (MongoDB)
📌 Overview

Part 2 of this project focuses on designing and implementing a NoSQL data model using MongoDB to store a rich, semi-structured product catalog.

Unlike Part 1 (relational ETL in MySQL), this part demonstrates how MongoDB efficiently handles nested and hierarchical product data such as specifications, reviews, tags, and metadata.

🎯 Objectives

Design a document-based data model

Store complex product information in MongoDB

Leverage nested documents and arrays

Support flexible and scalable product catalog queries

📂 Input Dataset
File	Description
products\_catalog.json	Product catalog with nested attributes and reviews
🧱 Data Model Design
Collection: products\_catalog

Each document represents one product and contains:

Product metadata

Nested specifications

Embedded customer reviews

Tags for search and filtering

Timestamps for auditing

📄 Document Structure
{
"product\_id": "ELEC001",
"name": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra",
"category": "Electronics",
"subcategory": "Smartphones",
"price": 79999.00,
"stock": 150,
"specifications": { },
"reviews": \[ ],
"tags": \[ ],
"warranty\_months": 12,
"created\_at": "ISODate",
"updated\_at": "ISODate"
}

🔍 Key Design Decisions
✅ Embedded Documents

Specifications and reviews are embedded for fast read performance

Avoids expensive joins required in relational databases

✅ Flexible Schema

Different products can have different specifications

Supports easy addition of new attributes without schema changes

✅ Read-Optimized Model

Optimized for product browsing, filtering, and analytics

Ideal for high-read e-commerce workloads

🛠️ Technologies Used

MongoDB

JSON

MongoDB Compass / Mongo Shell

Python (optional for loading)

▶️ How to Load Data
Using Mongo Shell
use ecommerce\_db
db.products\_catalog.insertMany(require('./products\_catalog.json'))

Using MongoDB Compass

Open MongoDB Compass

Select database: ecommerce\_db

Select collection: products\_catalog

Import products\_catalog.json

🔎 Sample Queries
Find All Electronics Products
db.products\_catalog.find(
{ category: "Electronics" },
{ name: 1, price: 1, stock: 1 }
)

Find Products with Rating ≥ 4
db.products\_catalog.find({
"reviews.rating": { $gte: 4 }
})

Find Products by Tag
db.products\_catalog.find({
tags: "smartphone"
})

📈 Use Cases

Product browsing and search

Review analysis

Recommendation systems

Catalog analytics

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add indexing on category, price, and tags

Implement text search

Integrate with real-time recommendation engine

Add versioning for product updates
